## Contributing

Contributions to the display or functionality of the single page app are welcome. I will be sticking to vanilla HTML, CSS and JS though - no build tools or 3rd party libs please.

Suggestions on improvements to the recipe are welcome, but I may choose not to merge them. Feel free to create a "fork" with your variation if you're interested!
