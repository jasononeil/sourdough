        <p>
          Here is the process I use. I learned it from Bonnie Machell. She also
          gave me the starter I started with. I haven&#39;t looked into how to
          make a starter from scratch. If you live in Perth I&#39;m happy to
          share some with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process here is very prescriptive, but it is pretty forgiving. The
          parts I&#39;m careful with are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The amount of starter, flour, water and salt. I try keep this pretty
            exact, to the gram.
          </li>
          <li>
            The amount of time in the oven. I set timers for most of these steps
            but they&#39;re really quite forgiving. But you don&#39;t want to do
            all that and then burn your loaf because you left it in the oven too
            long.
          </li>
          <li>
            taking plenty of time. The yeast in the starter (and in the air and
            on your hands) needs time to do its thing. Taking the 8+ hours after
            feeding the starter, and the ~30 minutes between the steps, and then
            leaving it in the fridge overnight, all contribute to it having
            plenty of time to rise. This fermentation process is also what makes
            this bread easier to digest for people with mild gluten sensitivity.
            (I still wouldn&#39;t touch it if I had Coeliac disease though).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="feeding-the-starter">Feeding the starter</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>25g starter</li>
          <li>50g rye flour</li>
          <li>50g water</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mix it all together.</p>
        <p>
          You can either take starter out of the jar its in until there&#39;s
          25g left, or switch to a new jar. I find switching to a new jar and
          then throwing out / cleaning the leftovers easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          You want air to be able to get in, but no flies or anything. Leaving a
          piece of fabric over the top is good, but not an airtight lid.
        </p>
        <h3
          id="how-long-before-i-want-to-prepare-bread-should-i-feed-the-starter-"
        >
          How long before I want to prepare bread should I feed the starter?
        </h3>
        <p>
          You want to feed it 8-24 hours before you prepare bread. If you&#39;re
          preparing bread in the afternoon then feeding it in the morning is
          probably the latest you want to do it, especially if the weather is
          cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The starter should roughly double in size. In Summer it will rise
          faster and doesn&#39;t need as much time as it will in Winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you feed it multiple times over a few days the starter gets more
          active and this helps the bread rise more.
        </p>
        <h3 id="how-often-do-i-need-to-feed-it-">
          How often do I need to feed it?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you don&#39;t feed it often enough the starter gets gross. It gets
          a bit of a crust which you&#39;ll need to pull off etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summer you probably want to feed it every day. In winter you could
          probably do every second day. Some people feed it twice a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can put it in the fridge if you&#39;re not making bread and
          don&#39;t want to keep feeding it. Pull it out of the fridge to
          re-feed it every couple of weeks. If it has been in the fridge you
          probably want to feed it twice before preparing bread.
        </p>
        <h3 id="can-i-do-more-or-less-starter-">
          Can I do more or less starter?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The ratio I&#39;ve stuck to is 1 starter : 2 rye : 2 water. My mother
          in law does a completely different ratio (majority starter) and it
          seems to be similar results, though she feeds hers more regularly to
          keep it active.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 25g/50g/50g amount I listed is the smallest I&#39;ve gone that
          leaves enough to start a loaf and keep feeding. Its small enough that
          you don&#39;t have much starter to discard. If you&#39;re preparing 2
          loaves, you can double the amount you feed, or if you&#39;re worried
          about having such a small amount that you accidentally ruin it (drop
          it on the floor, let it go bad etc) you can do more. If you do more,
          you&#39;ll have more to discard. You can throw it out, or be creative
          and bake with it or make pancakes or something.

        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>80g starter</li>
          <li>350ml water</li>
          <li>500g white flour (or 250 wholemeal/250 white.</li>
          <li>11g salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tip: you can double and make two loaves at a time, splitting them in
          half at Step 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to experiment with different types of flours or different
          ratios you can. It may effect the amount of starter or water you need,
          and the amount of time in the oven, but most of the steps are
          otherwise the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          From step one to when it goes in the fridge you&#39;ll need about 4
          hours. So if you start at 5pm, you&#39;ll be putting it in the fridge
          at 9pm. You&#39;ll need to spend 1-5 minutes every half hour, so you
          just have to be around at home, but it&#39;s not very involved, its
          easy to do in between housework and TV shows etc. Yes, I have taken a
          bowl with dough in it to playgrounds and shopping centers during the
          fold steps. ðŸ™ˆ
        </p>
        <h3 id="step-1-mixing-starter-flour-water">
          Step 1: mixing starter, flour, water
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Add starter and water to a mixing bowl</li>
          <li>
            Swirl it around with a mixing spoon until the starter is spread
            around and the water is cloudy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add flour. Mix with a spoon and your hands until its well combined.
            Probably takes ~3 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try get it in a general ball shape. It&#39;ll be super sticky on
            your fingers. Getting it off your fingers probably takes longer than
            mixing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wait 30 minutes.</p>
        <h3 id="step-2-adding-salt">Step 2: adding salt</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pour half the salt on one side.</li>
          <li>
            &quot;Pinch&quot; it in - where there is salt on the dough grab it
            between your thumb and your index finger and squeeze into the dough.
            Do this all over until the salt is all squished in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flip the ball of dough to the other side and add the remaining salt,
            pinch it in.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wait 30 minutes.</p>
        <h3 id="step-3-laminating">Step 3: laminating</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Get a nice big clear bit of bench space. Spread water on it.</li>
          <li>Tip the dough out of the mixing bowl onto the bench.</li>
          <li>
            Use your fingers to push down on the dough and then stretch it out
            in all directions
          </li>
          <li>
            You want to get it as thin as it will go before it starts getting
            holes in it. (One or two holes is okay, it just means its time to
            stop).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fold it all back into the middle to make a big ball of dough again,
            put it back in the mixing bowl.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wait 40 minutes.</p>
        <h3 id="step-4-folding-every-half-hour-for-2-hours-">
          Step 4: folding (every half hour for ~2 hours)
        </h3>
        <p>
          You want to do this step 3 or 4 times, waiting half an hour after
          each. In warmer months it tends to rise faster and 3 is enough. In
          winter I find it sometimes needs to be 4, and maybe even with longer
          gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its okay to be more flexible with timing in this step. If you are
          watching a TV show that has 20 minute episodes or 40 minute
          episodes... do it in the TV show gaps! You just want to get 3 to 4
          folds down over about 2 hours.
        </p>
        <p>For each fold:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use your two index fingers to pick the dough up from underneath,
            making a little bar for the dough to hang over.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wait for gravity to make it droop down on either side of your
            fingers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then lay it down in the bowl again, laying the side facing away from
            you on the bench.
          </li>
          <li>This is a &quot;fold&quot;.</li>
          <li>Spin it around 180 and fold again.</li>
          <li>Spin it around 90 and fold it again.</li>
          <li>Spin it around 180 and fold it again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You should have folded it 4 times from 4 different sides. Wait ~30
          minutes and do the next fold.
        </p>
        <p>After you have done 3 or 4 folds, wait ~30 minutes.</p>
        <h3
          id="step-5-roll-it-put-it-in-a-basket-and-leave-in-the-fridge-overnight"
        >
          Step 5: roll it, put it in a basket and leave in the fridge overnight
        </h3>
        <p>
          First prepare the area for rolling the bread and putting it into a
          basket:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spread some flour on the bench (to stop the dough sticking).</li>
          <li>
            Prepare a bread basket to put the rolled dough in. It should have
            some fabric (perhaps a tea towel) to stop it sticking to the basket.
            Sprinkle some flour over the fabric too.
          </li>
          <li>
            Throughout this step feel free to keep sprinkling flour if it helps
            make the dough less sticky and easier to roll.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tip the dough onto the flour. It might take a while to peel off the
            bowl, but I just let gravity do it rather than using my fingers to
            peel it off.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tip: If you&#39;ve been preparing a double loaf, now is the time to
          split the loaf in half. If you have a dough cutter use that, otherwise
          a sharp knife. You want a nice clean cut rather than tearing it apart.
        </p>
        <p>Then roll it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stretch and flatten the dough into a square about 20cm by 20cm
          </li>
          <li>
            Grab the side of the square closest to you, and pull it / stretch it
            towards you, then fold it back into the middle
          </li>
          <li>
            Grab the side on the left and pull it / stretch it to the left, then
            fold it back to the middle
          </li>
          <li>
            Grab the side on the right and pull it / stretch it to the left,
            then fold it back to the middle
          </li>
          <li>
            Spin the dough around so the side you haven&#39;t pulled yet is
            facing you. Pull it / stretch it.
          </li>
          <li>
            This time instead of folding back to the middle, pull it until
            it&#39;s about a 20cm x 10cm rectangle.
          </li>
          <li>Roll the rectangle as tight as you can, like a sleeping bag.</li>
          <li>While doing this if you see any air bubbles, pop them.</li>
          <li>
            Pinch each of side of the roll. This will help trap air in the loaf
            while it&#39;s in the oven and help it rise.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don&#39;t roll it tight enough, you can try stretch it out
            and re-roll it - but maybe only retry this once. You don&#39;t want
            to over-handle the bread at this stage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Put it in the basket and leave it overnight:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Put it in the bread basket. If there is a seam along the roll of
            dough from where you rolled it, leave that facing down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wrap it in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge. It shouldn&#39;t
            be air-tight, but it will help the dough stay moist and not dry out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leave it in the fridge overnight. I&#39;ve done anywhere from 8
            hours to 34 hours (2 nights) and it is still fine.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I&#39;ve prepared a double loaf, baking one loaf the next
            morning, and the second loaf the following morning, has worked well
            for me.

          <li>Pre-heat to 240, with a dutch oven inside</li>
          <li>Sprinkle some flour onto some baking paper.</li>
          <li>Tip the loaf out of the basket onto baking paper</li>

          <li>
            Put the bread, on the baking paper, into the dutch oven, lid on, and

          <li>
            Wait 45 minutes before cutting into it. The heat inside the crust is
            still cooking the inside during this time. If you&#39;re in a rush
            you could probably cut it at 30, but I wouldn&#39;t go less.
