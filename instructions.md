# Making Sourdough

Here is the process I use. I learned it from Bonnie Machell. She also gave me the starter I started with. I haven't looked into how to make a starter from scratch. If you live in Perth I'm happy to share some with you.

The process here is very prescriptive, but it is pretty forgiving. The parts I'm careful with are:

- The amount of starter, flour, water and salt. I try keep this pretty exact, to the gram.
- The amount of time in the oven. I set timers for most of these steps but they're really quite forgiving. But you don't want to do all that and then burn your loaf because you left it in the oven too long.
- taking plenty of time. The yeast in the starter (and in the air and on your hands) needs time to do its thing. Taking the 8+ hours after feeding the starter, and the ~30 minutes between the steps, and then leaving it in the fridge overnight, all contribute to it having plenty of time to rise. This fermentation process is also what makes this bread easier to digest for people with mild gluten sensitivity. (I still wouldn't touch it if I had Coeliac disease though).

## Feeding the starter

- 25g starter
- 50g rye flour
- 50g water

Mix it all together.

You can either take starter out of the jar its in until there's 25g left, or switch to a new jar. I find switching to a new jar and then throwing out / cleaning the leftovers easier.

You want air to be able to get in, but no flies or anything. Leaving a piece of fabric over the top is good, but not an airtight lid.

### How long before I want to prepare bread should I feed the starter?

You want to feed it 8-24 hours before you prepare bread. If you're preparing bread in the afternoon then feeding it in the morning is probably the latest you want to do it, especially if the weather is cold.

The starter should roughly double in size. In Summer it will rise faster and doesn't need as much time as it will in Winter.

If you feed it multiple times over a few days the starter gets more active and this helps the bread rise more.

### How often do I need to feed it?

If you don't feed it often enough the starter gets gross. It gets a bit of a crust which you'll need to pull off etc.

In summer you probably want to feed it every day. In winter you could probably do every second day. Some people feed it twice a day.

You can put it in the fridge if you're not making bread and don't want to keep feeding it. Pull it out of the fridge to re-feed it every couple of weeks. If it has been in the fridge you probably want to feed it twice before preparing bread.

### Can I do more or less starter?

The ratio I've stuck to is 1 starter : 2 rye : 2 water. My mother in law does a completely different ratio (majority starter) and it seems to be similar results, though she feeds hers more regularly to keep it active.

The 25g/50g/50g amount I listed is the smallest I've gone that leaves enough to start a loaf and keep feeding. Its small enough that you don't have much starter to discard. If you're preparing 2 loaves, you can double the amount you feed, or if you're worried about having such a small amount that you accidentally ruin it (drop it on the floor, let it go bad etc) you can do more. If you do more, you'll have more to discard. You can throw it out, or be creative and bake with it or make pancakes or something.

## Preparing the bread

Ingredients:

- 80g starter
- 350ml water
- 500g white flour (or 250 wholemeal/250 white.
- 11g salt

Tip: you can double and make two loaves at a time, splitting them in half at Step 5.

If you want to experiment with different types of flours or different ratios you can. It may effect the amount of starter or water you need, and the amount of time in the oven, but most of the steps are otherwise the same.

From step one to when it goes in the fridge you'll need about 4 hours. So if you start at 5pm, you'll be putting it in the fridge at 9pm. You'll need to spend 1-5 minutes every half hour, so you just have to be around at home, but it's not very involved, its easy to do in between housework and TV shows etc. Yes, I have taken a bowl with dough in it to playgrounds and shopping centers during the fold steps. ðŸ™ˆ

### Step 1: mixing starter, flour, water

- Add starter and water to a mixing bowl
- Swirl it around with a mixing spoon until the starter is spread around and the water is cloudy.
- Add flour. Mix with a spoon and your hands until its well combined. Probably takes ~3 minutes.
- Try get it in a general ball shape. It'll be super sticky on your fingers. Getting it off your fingers probably takes longer than mixing.

Wait 30 minutes.

### Step 2: adding salt

- Pour half the salt on one side.
- "Pinch" it in - where there is salt on the dough grab it between your thumb and your index finger and squeeze into the dough. Do this all over until the salt is all squished in.
- Flip the ball of dough to the other side and add the remaining salt, pinch it in.

Wait 30 minutes.

### Step 3: laminating

- Get a nice big clear bit of bench space. Spread water on it.
- Tip the dough out of the mixing bowl onto the bench.
- Use your fingers to push down on the dough and then stretch it out in all directions
- You want to get it as thin as it will go before it starts getting holes in it. (One or two holes is okay, it just means its time to stop).
- Fold it all back into the middle to make a big ball of dough again, put it back in the mixing bowl.
- Wait 40 minutes.

### Step 4: folding (every half hour for ~2 hours)

You want to do this step 3 or 4 times, waiting half an hour after each. In warmer months it tends to rise faster and 3 is enough. In winter I find it sometimes needs to be 4, and maybe even with longer gaps.

Its okay to be more flexible with timing in this step. If you are watching a TV show that has 20 minute episodes or 40 minute episodes... do it in the TV show gaps! You just want to get 3 to 4 folds down over about 2 hours.

For each fold:

- Use your two index fingers to pick the dough up from underneath, making a little bar for the dough to hang over.
- Wait for gravity to make it droop down on either side of your fingers.
- Then lay it down in the bowl again, laying the side facing away from you on the bench.
- This is a "fold".
- Spin it around 180 and fold again.
- Spin it around 90 and fold it again.
- Spin it around 180 and fold it again.

You should have folded it 4 times from 4 different sides. Wait ~30 minutes and do the next fold.

### Step 5: roll it, put it in a basket and leave in the fridge overnight

First prepare the area for rolling the bread and putting it into a basket:

- Spread some flour on the bench (to stop the dough sticking).
- Prepare a bread basket to put the rolled dough in. It should have some fabric (perhaps a tea towel) to stop it sticking to the basket. Sprinkle some flour over the fabric too.
- Throughout this step feel free to keep sprinkling flour if it helps make the dough less sticky and easier to roll.
- Tip the dough onto the flour. It might take a while to peel off the bowl, but I just let gravity do it rather than using my fingers to peel it off.

Tip: If you've been preparing a double loaf, now is the time to split the loaf in half. If you have a dough cutter use that, otherwise a sharp knife. You want a nice clean cut rather than tearing it apart.

Then roll it:

- Stretch and flatten the dough into a square about 20cm by 20cm
- Grab the side of the square closest to you, and pull it / stretch it towards you, then fold it back into the middle
- Grab the side on the left and pull it / stretch it to the left, then fold it back to the middle
- Grab the side on the right and pull it / stretch it to the left, then fold it back to the middle
- Spin the dough around so the side you haven't pulled yet is facing you. Pull it / stretch it.
- This time instead of folding back to the middle, pull it until it's about a 20cm x 10cm rectangle.
- Roll the rectangle as tight as you can, like a sleeping bag.
- While doing this if you see any air bubbles, pop them.
- Pinch each of side of the roll. This will help trap air in the loaf while it's in the oven and help it rise.
- If you don't roll it tight enough, you can try stretch it out and re-roll it - but maybe only retry this once. You don't want to over-handle the bread at this stage.

Put it in the basket and leave it overnight:

- Put it in the bread basket. If there is a seam along the roll of dough from where you rolled it, leave that facing down.
- Wrap it in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge. It shouldn't be air-tight, but it will help the dough stay moist and not dry out.
- Leave it in the fridge overnight. I've done anywhere from 8 hours to 34 hours (2 nights) and it is still fine.
- If I've prepared a double loaf, baking one loaf the next morning, and the second loaf the following morning, has worked well for me.

## Baking

Note: temperatures are in Celsius and cooking times assume a fan forced oven. They might vary slightly depending on your oven.

- Pre-heat to 240, with a dutch oven inside
- Sprinkle some flour onto some baking paper.
- Tip the loaf out of the basket onto baking paper
- "Score" it - put 1 or more lines through it with a knife. Search the internet if you want to see how fancy you can get.
- Put the bread, on the baking paper, into the dutch oven, lid on, and then into the oven
- 24 minutes
- Take the lid off, drop temp to 230
- 13 minutes
- Take the bread out of the dutch oven and put on a cooling rack
- The base should be firm enough you can knock it like a door and hear a good sound
- Wait 45 minutes before cutting into it. The heat inside the crust is still cooking the inside during this time. If you're in a rush you could probably cut it at 30, but I wouldn't go less.

## Eat it

- It's so good when it's still warm!
- Though, it is harder to cut. While it is very fresh it is easier to cut the slices slightly wider.
- For the first hour, the crust piece is the best piece. After that it gets too chewy and is the worst piece.
